<p> My journey is from my apartment in the Bronx to school in Manhattan. I choose this as my journey because of how frustrating it is and because of how often I do it. The trip, by train, is 53 minutes to an hour according to Google Maps and consists of transferring once. On a map, the line that my trip creates is that of an almost straight line with a kink in the middle, where the train goes from the Bronx into Manhattan.
 
This journey is different each time for me because of multiple factors; one being because of my own mood and patience with the trains, and the second being how crowded or who is on the train. I begin by leaving my apartment and walking about 10 minutes in my neighborhood to get to the train, in this part of the journey I try to keep my eyes delivered from others and listen to my music, I walk quickly and my back is warm from it but my face is still cold. I watch the morning birds and squirrels run around the fountain a block from my house. I walk past closed stores, a diner, a dated mens formal clothing store, the jewelry store with cloths still covering jewellery in the window display. The smell is of nothing but cold morning air and it reminds me of home in Seattle. 

Once I get to the train station I usually double check how long the trip will take me on Google Maps even though I know the answer. I sit on the train if I can, putting my heavy bag on my lap. Every time I take the train I feel like a zoo animal with eyes staring at me, which is my least favorite part. I think about asking them what they are looking at but instead I pretend they are invisible and listen to my music. If I can’t sit, I stand for the trip and think about how heavy my shoulder bag is. Once at 125th street, half of the train ride, I transfer to the 4 or 5 express train, usually waiting one to two minutes for it to come after I have been there. These trains are usually more packed than the first train, but less stops so the standing is more tolerable. I get off at 14th street and slowly walk up the crowded stairs while people flat tire my white shoes. Once out of the staircase I speed walk to the other end of station to come out of the terminal on the right side.

 I walk past the police station, and fast and frustrated people like me. I see a few people waiting for someone to swipe them in, if I’m have time to spare in the morning I’ll do that. I walk around the market in Union in the mornings, passing slow people focused on their phones. I walk two blocks, passing the sketchers store and the pressed juicery to finally arrive at The New School.
